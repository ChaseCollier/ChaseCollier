***Hello!***

My name is Chase and I'm currently a masters student at Florida State University. 
I earned my degree in Environmental Science at FSU in 2022, then continued my education into Geographic Information Sciences. I plan to graduate in 2023.
Currently, I focus most of my research on phytoplankton blooms. More specifically, K. Brevis in the Gulf of Mexico.
I do not know yet if I will have the time/resources for collaborations in my field, but always feel free to reach out to me!
You can reach me at : cccollier@fsu.edu
